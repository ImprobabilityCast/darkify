# darkify
Converts a CSS file with a light theme to a CSS file with a dark theme. Unfortunately, the design is fundamentally flawed.
It is possible to get it to work on some valid inputs, but many will simply not work. In the future, one should write code
that stems from the CSS syntax as opposed to just hacking something together that works for some cases.
